NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 6. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning 
the regulation may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 9th Coast Guard District in Cleveland Ohio or at 
the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Buffalo, New York.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information 
concerning aids to navigation.  See Canadian list of Lights, Buoys and Fog Signals for information 
not included in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES. 
When the water surface is above Low Water Datum, bridge and overhead 
clearances are reduced correspondingly.  For clearances see U.S. 
Coast Pilot 6.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey, 
with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, U.S. Coast Guard, and 
Canadian Authorities.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication 
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - LOW WATER DATUM
Due to periodic high water conditions in the Great Lakes, some 
features charted as visible at Low Water Datum may be submerged, 
particularly in the near shore areas. Mariners should proceed with 
caution.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important 
supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are
replaced by other types or removed. for details
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid 
to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast 
Guard Light list and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


CAUTION - MARINERS
Mariners are warned that numerous uncharted stakes and fishing structures, 
some submerged, may exist in the area of this chart. Such structures are not 
charted unless known to be permanent


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation.  Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart 
are not shown hereon.  Information may be 
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District 
Offices as racing and other private buoys are 
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.  
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Detroit, MI		KEC-63		162.550 MHz
Sandusky, OH	        KHB-97		162.400 MHz
Toledo, OH		WXL-51		162.550 MHz


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


SAILING DIRECTIONS
Bearings of sailing courses are true and distances given thereon are in 
statute miles between points of departure.

SAILING COURSES
Sailing courses and limits are recommended by 
the Lake carriers Association and the Canadian Shipowners Association.


CAUTION - LAKE ERIE FISH NETTING AREAS
Various types of nets are employed in Lake Erie of
which gill nets, impounding nets and trap nets may
create a hazard to mariners. These are marked by
buoys or stakes.
