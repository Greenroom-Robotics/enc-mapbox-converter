CAUTION - QUALITY OF BATHYMETRIC DATA

The areas represented by the object M_QUAL (Quality of data) are approximate due
to generalizing for clarity. Caution is advised, particularly for nearshore navigation
or voyage planning. M_QUAL represents areas of uniform quality of bathymetric
data. The CATZOC (Category of zone of confidence in data) attribute of M_QUAL
provides an assessment of the overall zone of confidence. Channels maintained by
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are periodically resurveyed and the quality of data
in these channels has not been assessed.
